## Project Story
This was a homework assignment during coding boot camp that I did not complete. I created a landing index.html, wrote a few javascript questions, and did not give my fledging programmer brain enough time to plan and complete. I submitted my one html page and was kindly allowed to continue with the boot camp. 

### MVP
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for this assignment required the following to generate a secure password for an internet user:
- Upon clicking the `start` button, the user will be presented with quiz questions as a timer counts downs. 
- For every wrong answer, time will be subtracted from the clock. 
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, the quiz is over and the user is presented with a score. 
- The user can save their initials and score in local storage.
